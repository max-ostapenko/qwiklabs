# Introduction to SQL for BigQuery and Cloud SQL

## Task 1. The basics of SQL

1. A keyword that specifies the fields (e.g. column values) that you want to pull from your dataset.
   - SELECT

2. Specifies what table or tables we want to pull our data from.
   - FROM

3. Allows us to filter tables for specific column values.
   - WHERE

## Task 2. Exploring the BigQuery console

1. A fully-managed petabyte-scale data warehouse that runs on the Google Cloud.
BigQuery

2. Projects contain datasets, and datasets contain tables.
   - True

3. With BigQuery, you can access datasets shared publicly from other Google Cloud projects.
   - True

## Task 3. More SQL Keywords: GROUP BY, COUNT, AS, and ORDER BY

1. Aggregates rows that share common criteria (e.g. a column value) and will return all of the unique entries found for such criteria.
   - GROUP BY

2. A SQL function will count and return the number of rows that share common criteria.
   - COUNT

3. Creates an alias of a table or column.
   - AS

4. Sorts the returned data from a query in ascending or descending order based on a specified criteria or column value.
   - ORDER BY

## Task 4. Working with Cloud SQL

## Task 5. Create a Cloud SQL instance

## Task 6. New queries in Cloud SQL
